The goals and objectives of this project are to make a working application, implement ES6 classes, write clean and reusable code, including JavaScript tests and used objects,and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation. 

Our JavaScript tests successfully pass all of the tests that show our data is working.
We implemented a best practice to follow single responsibility principle and wrote our code in ES6 syntax. 

We created dashboard to display information in a clear way.
